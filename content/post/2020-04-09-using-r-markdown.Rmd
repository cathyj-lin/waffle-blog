This section is written in markdown. It is used primarily for discussion, explanation etc. 

First let's load package.

```{r packageload, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(slumdown)
```

This would usually be about waffles... but I will do something about cars and the `mpg` data frame.

```{r picture}
pic <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  theme_slum(palette = "kunoichi") +
  xlab("Engline Displacement") +
  ylab("Highway Mileage")
```

The above chunk has creased the `pic` variable. To draw the plot, need to include the R command `print(pic)`.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
print(pic)
```
